## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Structured the document and defined the semantic layout.
* **CSS3:** Designed the "Minimalist Slate" UI using **CSS Grid** for responsiveness and **Transitions** for interactive hover effects.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Implemented **Dynamic DOM Manipulation** to render event cards from a data array, ensuring the site is easy to update.
* **GitHub Pages:** Utilized for deployment and production hosting.

## 💡 Development Approach

* **Data-Driven Content:** I separated the content from the structure. By storing event details in a JavaScript array, the project is **scalable**—new events can be added without modifying the HTML or CSS.
* **Fluid Responsiveness:** Using the `auto-fit` and `minmax` functions in CSS Grid, the interface adapts seamlessly to different screen resolutions (Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop) without the need for complex media queries.
* **UI/UX Focus:** The design uses a slate-grey gradient and subtle box-shadows to create a sense of depth, ensuring a professional look that highlights key information like event dates and titles.
* **Branding:** Includes the official CSI SB MBCET logo and footer links to maintain brand consistency with the official domain.
